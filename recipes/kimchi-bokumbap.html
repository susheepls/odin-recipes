    <p>Kimchi Bokumbap(kimchi fried rice) is one of my favorite meals of all time. The tasty rice filled with different vegetables and meats
        all come together with a nice egg on top. The name is also really fun to say outloud.
    </p>
    <p>With my recipe, I will tell you how my mother used to make this delicious meal. Whenever she made this meal, I would start drooling from
        just the scent, and I hope you will too.

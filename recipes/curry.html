    <p>One of my <strong>favorite</strong> meals in Japan is curry over rice. It doesn't have to have katsu on top, and 
        it can be a healthy meal depending on its content. Ignore the picture; its just my favorite place to eat curry if im not cooking.
    </p>
    <p>In this recipe, we will make sure that the curry contains a healthy amount of vegetables and meats.
        Doing so, you can create a delcious,well balanced meal that you will love eating every night.

    <p>This is a recipe for my favroite side dish that my mother used to make. It is
        very simple but delicious, and can compliment any other meal, especially meats.

    <p>I hope that you will be able to realize that cooking has the ability to make simple 
        veggies into a powerhouse of flavor and satisfaction.
